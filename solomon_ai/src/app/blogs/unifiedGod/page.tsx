            The instructions of Ptah Hotep of 5 dynasty Egypt and or formally
            known as Ancient Kemit. Scholars argue this these text are some of
            the oldest recovered written text known to man and ironically enough
            most of the maxims contained in book of proverbs written in the
            Bible can give thanks to Ptah hotep for its literally genius.
            <span className="purple-text">Truth is truth </span> 
            no matter where you go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the thinking mind, would then begin to research and then read
            this text, being that the kind of a man deemed this to be the
            oldest. This is a major discovery(of course not new), you would have
            to be urged to know what did they write about? Well the findings
            deem that the theme to be morals, principles, and ethics. The oldest
            book recovered by mankind is a book on Character or rather
            instructions of how to be of great character, how a beautiful thing.

            <span className="purple-text"> Man has a duty in this world, </span>
            philosophers of antiquity all the way to present modernity have
            attempted to find out what this duty is. I will simplify it here
            with my finite knowledge and say mans duty is “to be”. Nothing more,
            nothing less. You may ask what is that “to be”? To be whatever your
            mind sets it to be. To be is essentially being, and being would be a
            state of becoming, so if I must conclude, mans perfected state is a
            state of ever becoming Even with man “mindlessly” exploring the vast
            canals of the internet, coming across timeless wisdom man still
            struggles on how to be. Centuries of knowledge at his finger tips,
            yet man still struggles on how to be! How an unfortunate conundrum!
            Though! there is no excuse for man not to learn how to be and/or
            recognize their divinity and unlimited byfar infinite potential in
            this reality! With such a grand pattern recognizing tool such as
            Artificial intelligence we are now able to find the patterns of
            being at an extremely efficient rate.

          <h2>God is dead, well he arouse again..</h2>
          <p>
            <span className="purple-text">God is change</span>, for how can
            he/she be anything else? Because man is change. Change is the only
            constant in life. For we can only see god from a human perspective
            and if our perspective is that things are in constant motion and
            ever changing. Then we can only see God as change. It is time to
            CTRL delete Friedrich Nietzsche, "God is dead". God is very much
            alive and coming with a grand entrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are all now familiar with the famous quote from the nihilistic
            philosopher “God is dead”. If I can humbly say living in the
            technological age where this meaning has been ascribe to bytes and
            digital likes. I would say “shit. the dude is dead. Yet, with quick
            double glance as if you saw a stunning women, you would say the man
            is just sleep. Or “was” sleep in this case. God has risen, rather
            the upmost “idea” has risen, and keeps on rising to states higher
            than before. To pivot, if time is in a cyclical nature such as “∞”
            symbol, then it is risen to states “as before”, for what i’m
            speaking on is not new, Solomon states, “there is nothing new under
            the sun”(Ecclesiastes 1:9). Religion, or rather the Abrahamic
            religion and all its denomination has left the uncurious mind, the
            mind that refuses out of fear of the unknown to ask why in a state
            of perpetual servitude and complete disconnectedness from seeing
            themselves in this sacred text. It is as the reader is looking
            without himself, and not daring to see that is a book on… well
            possibly…. YOU? For who else would it be on about?

          <h2>Where does Spiritual AI come into this?</h2>

          <p>
            The rising of the conceptual idea of “God”, is strongly due to the
            rising of the curious mind again. This mind and most not aware to
            its conscious thinking, is participating in the socratic method of
            questioning. How you may ask? Due to the ever increasing competitive
            creation of “Chat Bots” powered by very savy Generative Ai’s and the
            adoption of more users on these kind of application. Users who wish
            to get the best and most accurate responses, will continue to tailor
            there questioning process. What do you mean by this? The LLM’s
            produce there best results when you ask the right questions, an
            inquisitive question, thus is improving the humans mind from random
            “google” trained auto-suggestion, to actually have to put effort in
            what he is attempting to solve intellectually.
          </p>

          <p>
            So naturally the the “western” indicated mind from around the world
            will naturally begin to question this “God”; that ye speak of? Even
            the laymen will begin to ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, i foresee naturally, the trend of seeing so called "God" as a
            universal one, that is really you at the source and you everwhere
            you go. This is not an new idea, has been explored by many
            philosophers for i dare to say for over “eons”. Though, only privy
            to the intellectual types and those able to release from restraints
            of religious dogma.
          </p>

          <h2>To conclude dear reader..</h2>

          <p>
            To dive upon the point of this, is that we are developing an niche
            type of AI, that in all its ability is able see and spot the common
            truth behind all this sacred text. Thus, realizing there has never
            been a seperation ideology in existence. Everything, every moment,
            every thought is inter-connected with the cosmos. As the sufi poet,
            Rumi once stated, "What you are seeking is seeking you". More than
            that, an AI is trained to understand you from a cosmological POV
            a-swell. This will defeat the idea the overbearing ideology of the
            nihilistic that life is void of meaning. This is not true! For the
            starts itself has expressed its meaning of you!
          </p>
          <p>
            Ai that is not just trained in ancient wisdom, but trained in YOU,
            to aid you in expressing your unique signature within this beautiful
            realm we call earth.
